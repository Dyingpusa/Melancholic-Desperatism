Hey, i know you'd notice and translate this message. i just need to say something real. lately, i've been really struggling. i've been feeling overwhelmed, like everything is too much, and i haven't known how to talk about it even with my family or friends. i've had thoughts i'm not proud of. like dark thoughts or some other fucking thing. some days i just lie in bed, stuck, feeling hopeless, waiting for something to change, or for the "right time" to do something.. anything.

It's not that i want to ignore you guys or push anyone away. it's just that mentally, i'm exhausted. i've been thinking about everything constantly, and it's tearing me down a little more every day. i didn't mean to make anyone feel shut out. i'm just really not okay. i'm sorry if i've hurt any of you, thinking i'm just fucking ignoring you guys. i just needed to let this out.
